Statement of completion - Project Group 1

The project to build a SHA3 encryption engine was challenging, in the fact that the design had strict constraints on the number of cycles and the cycle time. The constraint on the number of cycles meant that any delay in data processing will lead to a failure. Due to this reason, the design had to be pipelined in 3 stages, each stage running in parallel to others and control flags for each stage. Initially, a FIFO on the input was implemented, and the combinational logic for the permutations was tried out. This failed because the cycle time constraint meant that the Logic delay could not be greater than some number, this some number was (total logic delay)/8. Also, there was an attempt to reduce the number of cycles taken in the permutations, this didnâ€™t work because of setup violations during synthesis. An attempt to complete the combinational logic in one cycle failed with the synthesis taking forever to run(>8hrs) and eventually crashing. All in all, the final method of pipelining the design worked really well. Never in the path did it take more than 8 cycles for the output to come out and synthesis passed with good margin.
