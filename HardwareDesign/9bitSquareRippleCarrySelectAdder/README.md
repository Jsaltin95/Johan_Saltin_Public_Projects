Hello there!

In the 9-bit squate root carry select adder, me and a group made sucessfully simualted the device through Cadence Virtuoso.

The goal was to sucessfully create the layouts, digital logic, and a report. To add uppon the project, we wanted to define the area, and delay of the circuitry, but were not able to due to time constraints. Because the software was apointed for a class, it wasn't possible to continue as a side project due to the inability to buy the software.

However, we accomplished to generate a synthesizing layout of a 9-bit square root cary select adder.
