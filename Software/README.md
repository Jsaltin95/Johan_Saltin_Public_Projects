Hello!

This is a simple chip game between 2 players. The players start with inputting a valid integer. Thereafter, the game rolls a value between the inputted value and 1. It will remove
the randomed amount of chip from the pile of chips until there are none left. The player who had to take away the last chip loses.

Happy Coding!
